# Text2Sentiment

Text2Sentiment is a flexible, reusable framework for building Text Classification models. This repository is specifically designed for PyTorch and can be applied to numerous different datasets.

Inspired by [bentrevett's PyTorch Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/1%20-%20Simple%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb) and the [PyTorch Documentation Examples](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/main/beginner_source/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.py), this project was created to modernize older resources and replace the usage of legacy packages.

The initial implementation performs Sentiment Analysis on the TorchText IMDB dataset, but the architecture of the codebase allows for easy adaptation to other text datasets.

## Skills and Technologies Used

The project heavily relies on:

- Python
- PyTorch
